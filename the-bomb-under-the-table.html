			<p class = "intro">“This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.” Alien uses the final girl trope of the horror genre to its best strengths. </p>

			<p>In Ridley Scott's Alien, it is not made obvious who exactly is going to make it to the end until about halfway through, depending on the viewer. The way the film does this is by diversifying its cast, giving each character a feature or two that seems like it might let them survive. In addition to that, we have a great spread of screen time for the first half of the film. All this makes predicting who will survive the night more challenging and engages the viewer more with the decision making of each of its characters. </p>

			<p>Alien does not have stupid characters. While each member of the crew may have their respective moments, the situation in which they make a mistake is almost always understandable. This believability is significant, especially among many other horror films that make their protagonists painfully obvious from the get-go and focus entirely on building that one character. By writing them with a higher IQ, Scott can give each character the attention they deserve. It is necessary for each one to feel convincing enough to be the center of the film. </p>

			<p>It is by creating an even playing field that Scott sets us up for the ultimate mystery. Who in this cast has what it takes to survive this horrifying encounter? Any viewer would know from the trailer, advertisement, or eerie opening of the film that the Nostromo is on a course for disaster. The suspense builds off this knowledge and refuses to give away its final crew member until we are sworn to fear by the "perfect organism". Further playing into this suspense is the well-known final girl trope. </p>

			<p>In horror, there is a frequent occurrence where one character is destined to make it to the end. The origin of this trope is a topic of heated debate, but many agree on Texas Chainsaw Massacre as setting the blueprint. In the film, a cast of characters is picked off one by one throughout the runtime only for the smartest and most clearly capable character to fight her way to the credits. The problem with this trope is once it becomes a regular occurrence in the genre, it stops being satisfying. Instead, it becomes more predictable and cliché, cutting the possibility of any close calls to result in real consequence for the main character, killing the suspense. However, in Alien, the viewers' awareness of this trope is considered and used to elevate its horror. While the masterpiece of Alien is undoubtedly its use of its titular creature, what sets us off on the journey is the unease of knowing the inevitable. </p>

			<p>The brilliantly deep writing behind each of Alien's characters serves to set the tone of the film with suspense. Many horror films since have gotten it wrong and continue to over simplify the characters that have no intention of making good decisions or surviving. Among many other successes, Alien successfully convinces the viewer that no one is safe.</p>
