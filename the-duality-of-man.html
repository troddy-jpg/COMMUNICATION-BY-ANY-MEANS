				<h1>The Duality of Man</h1>
				<p>Snowcrash (2014), novel</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class = "intro">Bicameralism is the hypothesis, which states that the human mind is broken into two parts, one that acts and another which obeys. Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash explores the battle between these two halves of the brain.</p>

			<p>Stephenson writes about what it means be human. In an interview following the release of one of his later novels, Stephenson spoke briefly about how The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind was one of the main influences for Snow Crash (Mustich). The novel he references is a psychology book written by Julian Jaynes in 1976 which famously proposed the controversial hypothesis of the Bicameral mind. The novel discusses “…the difference between what others see of us and our sense of our inner selves and the deep feelings that sustain it” (Jaynes). Stephenson uses the idea of the Bicameral mind and applies it to cyberpunk and science fiction. </p>

			<p>In Snow Crash duality is found everywhere. Early in the novel, Stephenson uncovers this theme with the idea of computers being built on the foundations of duality. Binary in a computer uses two dissimilar parts, zero and one, to create meaning. By highlighting the computer’s way of discerning between two parts, Stephenson creates a comparison to the human brain. Using what we know about the influence of this idea, we can assume Stephenson made this comparison with the Jayne’s hypothesis in mind. Stephenson uses this idea to create further meaning in Snow Crash in the ways that computers create information. Rather than images on a screen, computers in Snow Crash create life and entire worlds. </p>

			<p>By creating the Metaverse, Stephenson gives further power to the duality powered computers. The ability for computers to simulate life puts them on the same level as humans. More than that, computers can show us our own perception. If computers can replicate human perception, then surely a human is no more than something like ones and zeros as well. This is the argument that Stephenson creates by making use of the hypothesis of the Bicameral mind. By placing value on the computer's ability to discriminate between two dissimilar halves and create meaning and life from that sets us up for that to be taken away.</p>

			<p>The being which loses one of its two Bicameral halves is not a computer however, it is humans. The Asherah brain hack in Snow Crash simply takes away the part of the brain which is responsible for people's inner monologue. The great emotion and mental maintenance its take in order to sustain that part of the brain as described by Jaynes is destroyed. When this happens, we see what becomes of people with only a singular existence. </p>

			<p>Stephenson is making the claim that people cannot simply exists as vessels through which things are done. The human condition is not made of surface level decisions and drones carrying out orders. For humanity to thrive it must rely on the ego, and the inner monologue that the ego supports. Without the duality of what we think and what we do, without dissimilarity, humans are nothing.</p>
