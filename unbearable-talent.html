				<h1>Depth in a Meta-Narrative Film</h1>
				<p>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022), film</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<p class = "intro"><em>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</em> is a meta film on the career of Nicholas Cage. To this end, as the film self describes, it “works on multiple levels.” While much of the films self-writing plot feels very overt, certain moments offer more nuance to the subject matter. On my first viewing of the film, two scenes stand out as subtle and smart.</p>

				<p>First scene: Nicholas Cage attempts to grab some security footage during a party but accidentally drugs himself with CIA incapacitation tech. Following this blunder, the actor must precariously shimmy along the outside of the third floor window &amp; reclaim the antidote he locked in the security room after leaving the keys inside. Throughout the ordeal, the two CIA agents directing him through an earpiece argue about the fate of Nicholas Cage. One remains pessimistic, saying that he wont be able to get the antidote on time and has met his fate. The other remains hopeful, offering Nicholas support as he nearly blacks out getting himself through the window. Just when Cage is about to pass out before stabbing him with the needle, the supportive agent calls out to his instincts “Action!” and Nicholas saves himself. </p>
				<p class = "intro">While much of the film is spent talking directly about the career of Nicholas Cage, this scene takes a metaphorical approach. The self-drugging reflecting Nick cages own struggles; the opposing viewpoints of the agents as an allegory for the voices of the fans as perceived by Nick; and the valiant, but filled with struggle victory of Nicholas in giving himself the antidote through his acting as a metaphor for the recent revitalization of his career. This scene paint a vivid picture of Nicholas’s career and character while maintaining a tense action sequence &amp; not pulling the viewer out of the fourth wall at an inopportune time.
				</p>
				<p>Second scene: Javi goes to meet his cousin Paco León to learn about Nicholas’s involvement, there's a predominate featuring of the Kellogg sponsorship (which I am assuming the film has.) León intimidates Javi into eating the fruit loops, all while raving about how much he likes fruit loops. After Javi hesitantly takes a bite, so does León and the scene continues to the main conflict.</p>
				<p class = "intro">Like the first scene, this comes across as seriously tense in the film. It builds up León’s character just in time for him to become the real main villain. It taps into the tension we felt before with León and presents the villain switch with satisfying reasoning. On top of building that character/tension, the scene wonderfully conveys the writers feelings about having to include the Kellogg’s sponsorship. I read the tense force feeding as a metaphor for the very apparent sponsorships squeezed into the film. This criticism / gag fits perfectly in line with the films assertion of its own “Hollywood genre blockbuster” third act written for the trailer.</p>
