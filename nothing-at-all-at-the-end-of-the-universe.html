			<p class = "intro">At the start of the second episode in The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, our narrator describes a girl who had solved world peace moments before the world had been evaporated. In this scene, The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy uses satire and comedy to critique Christianity as the prominent religion in the West and illustrate insignificance. </p>

			<p>The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy points out that even in the most widely believed religion story, there is the idea of violence to obtain peace. It describes the story of the crucifixion of Jesus as a “man [who] had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change.” By stripping the story of its sophistication, the radio show is demythologizing it, and ridiculing its overwhelming significance in our culture. It also critiques followers of Christ and points out the irony in needing an act of violence to bring about peace. Not only did obtaining peace require brutal sacrifice, but it also was followed by many years of bloodshed. In addition to pointing out this irony, it also creates a juxtaposition. </p>

			<p>The girl in the café works as a juxtaposition to the Christ story. After the simplification of the story, we are introduced to a girl sitting in a café. The narrator tells us she has thought of a way to world peace, that “This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.” The narrator is comparing the girl’s plan to the death of Jesus and saying that hers will create peace whereas Christianity incited violence. It further advances the irony in implying that her plan will work. This comparison serves as an effective humor device. It points out the irony in that a plan created by one individual would work better than a religion, whose several-thousand-year-old mission has been to incite peace. This juxtaposition further strengthens the criticisms of the show and helps with its ultimate point: the insignificance of either of these solutions. </p>

			<p>The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy employs absurdist humor to create a feeling of insignificance. Right after the narrator tells us about the girl who finally discovered the solution to peace, they reveal that before she could even get to the phone, the Earth was destroyed. This serves as a comedic effect, as the listener already knows that the Earth has been destroyed and this just acts as a well-timed reminder. Almost Kafkaesque, the show teases us with its critique of Christianity and the story's own solution for peace, only to have it all destroyed by an unstoppable force. This motif carries throughout the show, but in this instance, it is most prevalent. </p>

			<p>Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy uses absurdist humor and juxtaposition to satirize the death of Jesus. By doing this, it builds on its existential themes and ideas. This is not isolated to one instance. Later in the show, it is revealed that Earth is a supercomputer and that it was minutes away from finishing a ten-million-year-long calculation meant to answer the Ultimate Question before it was evaporated. The show uses these scenes to show us that regardless of how important something may be, nothing in the universe truly matters.</p>
