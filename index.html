<!--How can I have all my text centered in a column, but have the very first line with a left hanging heading? ie-

|		  Website Title!		 |
|			         			 |
|			 		 			 |
|	Heading->pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |

Also: change bg color to be according to the average of all the images on the page


-hover effect instead of underline for paying in youth title

-create seperate css file for the bomb under the table and edits its css there (seperate css from style.css as well. maybe import two css docs per page, one for that page and style.css?)

-->
