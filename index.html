				<p style = "text-align:left"class = "intro">The holocaust by bullet cost the lives of 1.6 million civilians during the nazi occupation of Belarus during WWII (Zhukov, Yuri M). Come and See is an anti-war film released in 1985 directed by Elem Klimov. The film is based on the 1978 novel Khatyn and was co-written (along with Klimov) by the book's author, Ales Adamovich (Chapman). The experience of Adamovich during this period, specifically his time as a teenage partisan, as well as other real world accounts of the war contributed greatly towards the writing of the book and film.</p>

<!--How can I have all my text centered in a column, but have the very first line with a left hanging heading? ie-

|		  Website Title!		 |
|			         			 |
|			 		 			 |
|	Heading->pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |
|			 pElement			 |

Also: change bg color to be according to the average of all the images on the page

-indent p on homepage
-hover effect instead of underline for paying in youth title
-Center film essays label but left align essay links?
-add a hover effect and hyper link to p element 

-->
