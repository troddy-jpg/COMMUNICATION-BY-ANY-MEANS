    - next to Essays, imagine there is a greyed out and a little further away word that said Notes off to the right with Essays still centered in the screen
    - You click on Notes, and suddenly Notes is in the center of your screen in black text, with Essays in grey off to the right
    - The content has changed from the current list of Essays with links to each individual essay to a yet-undesigned page containing all my notes I’ve ever taken on movies, even just brief / uneducated ones.
    - Can add in more pages
    - Other page idea: all the screenshots I grab, what film they are from, who shot them etc. cool film photography gallery of stills from films I’ve captured.

### Essays

- [ ]  Need to make note of which essays to edit / make brief summary of my thoughts about what to edit in order to make them better
- [ ]  keep in back of mind but work on other stuff - how to best display the names / info of the essays on the homepage
- [ ]  Put a star on essays that are notably less bad than the others
